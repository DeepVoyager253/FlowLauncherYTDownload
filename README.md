
Usage:
type **-yt (or your chosen action keyword) {URL}**
Then, Choose to download the video as a video or an audio file (mp3 or mp4)
After a few seconds, a message box will appear saying **Downloading**
It will then download the video and open your **Downloads** folder.

In the future, I plan on adding more features such as:
Choosing download destination
Getting the video's thumbmail/title into the query options
support for platforms other than youtube.


Hope you enjoy and if there are any problems/crashes please make sure to create an issue.
This plugin still needs some bug fixing, but i can find those better if you report them.

**IMPORTANT**
in some cases, there will be an error when this plugin runs. i recommend installing python 3.8.9 from this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-389/ and going to flow launchers settings, then selecting the installation path in the "python path" field. that fixes it.
